# <h1>ANGULAR-JS-PROJECTS</h1>

<h2>1: Storybook</h2>
<p>An open-source tool Storybook is specially designed for creating UI components in isolation for Vue, Angular, and React. Storybook is unique since it can run outside of an application, making it plausible to build UI components in isolation. In this way, when you design UI components, it enhances the testability and reusability factors of an app and also facilitates the development speed. Storybook exhibits an easy-to-use API that can be configured in minutes and can also be extended to cater to your dynamic needs. It includes many add-on features for component design, testing, documentation, etc. With Storybook, you don’t have to worry about application-specific dependencies.</p>

<h2>2: Angular Jumpstart</h2>
<p>The Angular JumpStart project offers a complete application that shows many key features presented by the Angular framework.

A few of the project features consist of:

TypeScript modules and classes
Modules are loaded with System.js
Determining routes, comprising child routes and lazy loaded routes
Utilising Custom Components, including output properties and custom input
Utilising Custom Directives
Utilising Custom Pipes
Distinguishing properties and utilising events in directives/components
Adopting the Http object for the purpose of Ajax calls with RxJS observables
Functioning with utility and service classes (for sorting and Ajax calls)
Adopting Angular data binding Syntax [], () and [()]
Adopting template-driven and reactive forms’ functionality for data capturing and validation</p>

<h2>3: Compodoc</h2>
<p>Compodoc is just the right tool you need if you are eyeing an effective documentation tool for Angular apps. For all Angular applications, Compodoc can design static documentation. It can render documentation for the standard Angular APIs, including common classes, components, injectables, routes, modules, directives, and pipes. Compodoc includes 8 themes derived from some of the most common documentation tools, such as Stripe, Postmark, Gitbook, Read the Docs, Laravel, Vagrant, and Material design. Furthermore, Compodoc has a huge search engine, namely lunr.js, that can readily search and display the information you want to access. The best part is Compodoc offers unique support for Angular-CLI projects. The content rests on the right side, in Compodoc documentations, on the other hand, the primary endpoints are on the left side. </p>

<h2>4: Game Analyser</h2>
<p>Before the release of games for common people, it is goes through different tests that determine its entertainment quotient and other critical elements such as clarity level. Game testing algorithms have been quite difficult and incoherent, this new game analyser designed on Angular can change the way people handle modern art. Designers and programmers are going to have an effortless experience building games. You can speak with potential users and make the best of modifications in their game. This game analyzer will get you a lot of buyers and a lot of regular customers. Also, it is one of the most popular project ideas, as it offers customers with many chances to go out and make a mark on their faculties and clients. Experienced professionals should aim to pursue this only if they are positive about their knowledge of game designing and development. One must cultivate a gamer’s attitude while designing this project, else it will cannot excite gamers and not yield potential clients.</p>
